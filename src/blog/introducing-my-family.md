I will start off by introducing my Philippine Family,
and then I will continue with my life in the Philippines.

First, there is my wife, Jenny. She is my one and only, the love of my life, and also known as my better half.

Then comes our oldest daughter, Jenwinah-Justine.
We call her Tintin. That comes from JusTINe Part of her name. Those type of nicknamesare quite common in the Philippines. Just close by there is a school age girl and her name is Maurille, but every one calls her Mau Mau.

She's 18 and she just finished her first year of college. She did very well (all A's and B's), I am very, very pleased with her performance. In fact,she received a reward for being an outstanding student. She's planning on becoming a medical technologist.

Then comes are youngest child, Ashley. She's 14 and is going in the 9th grade. She's also an excellent student. She's received honors all through 8th grade. 
Although with her I have a little problem. She doesn't listen very well. But I will break her of that.

When Tintin were younger I had a similar problem. But she has matured nicely and we are very, very close. I'm hoping it will be the same way with Ashley as she mature.

Next time I'll talk about adapting to the Philippine culture.
